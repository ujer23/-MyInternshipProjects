Data Breach Investigation Project: ABC SecureBank

Objective
Investigate a data breach at ABC SecureBank to determine its scope, analyze its impact, recover exposed data, and recommend security improvements.


Scenario
Company Name: ABC SecureBank  
Discovery: Breach identified during a routine audit.  
Impact:Potential exposure of sensitive customer data, including names, account numbers, and transaction history.


Tasks

1.Incident Analysis

Objective: Investigate the breachâ€™s cause, point of entry, extent, and timeframe.
- Analyze system logs to identify suspicious activities.
- Tools: `grep`, `awk`, or Splunk for log parsing.
- Example:
  ```bash
  grep "failed" /var/log/auth.log
  ```

2.Forensic Analysis

Objective: Collect and analyze evidence from affected systems.
- Perform disk imaging using tools like `dd`:
  ```bash
  sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/image.img bs=1M
  ```
- Use( Autopsy) or (Volatility) for file and memory analysis.
- Inspect for malware using Wireshark to capture network traffic.

3.Data Recovery

Objective:Assess the extent of data exposure and recover critical information.
- Recover deleted files using Scalpel:
#bash
  sudo scalpel [image_file] -o [output_directory]
- Identify the data exposed using logs or database queries.

4.Regulatory Compliance

Objective:** Ensure legal and regulatory adherence.
- Draft reports for compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA):
  - Include breach details, exposed data, and mitigation actions.
  - Submit within the required timeframe to relevant authorities.

5.Communication and Notification

Objective:  Inform stakeholders and customers.
- Draft clear notifications for:

- Recommendations:
  - Update systems regularly.
  - Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS).
  - Conduct employee training on phishing prevention.
