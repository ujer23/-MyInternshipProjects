Network Vulnerability Assessment Presentation

1: Title Slid
Title:Network Vulnerability Assessment
Subtitle:Findings and Mitigation Plan
Presented By: Ujer Kazi
Date: 31/12/2024


2: Objectives
Purpose of the Assessment:
  - Identify critical vulnerabilities in the simulated network.
  - Develop effective mitigation strategies.
  - Improve overall network security.


3: Tools and Methodology
- Tools Used:
  - Nessus
  - OpenVAS
  - Nmap (for additional scans)
- Steps Followed:
  1. Scan the network for vulnerabilities.
  2. Analyze scan results to identify critical issues.
  3. Create a mitigation plan.
  4. Document findings.


4: Vulnerability 1 Example
Name: Outdated Web Server Software
Severity:  Critical
Description: Web server running an older version prone to known exploits.
Potential Impact:  Data breach, unauthorized access.
Mitigation Plan:
  1. Update the server to the latest version.
  2. Configure automatic updates.


5: Vulnerability 2 Example
Name: Weak Password Policy
Severity: High
Description:  Passwords lack complexity requirements.
Potential Impact: Brute force attacks leading to unauthorized access.
Mitigation Plan:
  1. Implement strong password policies.
  2. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).


6: Other Identified Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability  	Severity	Impact                  	Solution Summary
Open Ports ports 	 High	 Unauthorized access	Close unused 
 Unpatched OS 	Medium	 Exploitable loopholes	 Regular updates
Misconfigured Firewall Reconfigure rules  	High	High	 Weak defense perimeter



Slide 7: Summary of Findings

Total Vulnerabilities Identified: 5
Critical Issues: 2
High Severity Issues:  2
Medium Severity Issues:1


8: Mitigation Strategy Overview
1. Patch Management: Regular updates for software and OS.
2. Access Control: Implement MFA and strong password policies.
3. Network Hardening:
   - Close unused ports.
   - Reconfigure firewall
4. Continuous Monitoring:Schedule regular vulnerability scans.



9: Timeline and Resources
-Estimated Timeline:
  - Initial Remediation: 2 weeks
  - Ongoing Maintenance: Monthly
-Resources Required:
  - Skilled IT personnel
  - Updated scanning tools
  - Time allocation for monitoring


10: Recommendations
